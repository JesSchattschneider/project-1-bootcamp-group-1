title: Project 1: Finding data engineering jobs
---

---
# Objective

The objective of our project is to provide analytical datasets from jobs posted in Findwork API and their relation to the population size of where these opportunities are available.

## Consumers

New data engineers who want to know where to look for jobs and which cities have the potential of being less competitive based on their population size.

## Questions

 - Are remote jobs growing over time?
 - What job roles are most common?
 - What are the most common employment types?
 - What is the population of the top 10 cities with more job opportunities?
