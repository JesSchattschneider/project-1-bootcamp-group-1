<p><em>brainbase is to ai workers what retool is to internal tools.</em></p>
<p><strong>very soon every company will have an ai workforce working alongside their human team.</strong> at brainbase we let businesses create their own enterprise-grade ai workers. everyone from smbs to government agencies are choosing us to create workers that do everything from outbound sales calls to customer support.</p>
<p>brainbase is built on an entirely new type of ai agent our founder developed during his phd at harvard, which allows for more complex workflows on a longer time horizon, enabling us to move entire workloads from human employees to ai workers.</p>
<p>our company was founded in january 2024 and <strong>we already hit our 100k+ arr milestone</strong> and have raised a seed round from yc, 500 global and other top tier firms, with participation from the founders of youtube and hubspot, as well as many top yc alumni.</p>
<h3><strong>about the role</strong></h3>
<p>as part of our founding team, you will have a high agency role in bringing ai to the enterprise. you will work one-on-one with our ceo and founding team to primarily brainstorm product directions, running sales campaigns, talking to users and shaping company culture for other team members to come.</p>
<h3><strong>who’s a good fit?</strong></h3>
<p>we think you should apply if the following sounds like you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>resourceful –</strong> you’ve been known to get a lot done with very little, whether it is time, money or compute</li>
<li>
<strong>resilient –</strong> you don’t quit when something is difficult, only when you have realized a better way to do it</li>
<li>
<strong>decisive –</strong> you can make informed decisions under stress with incomplete data, and move on to the next task (no hedging)</li>
<li>
<strong>l̶i̶k̶e̶ love difficult problems –</strong> you like working at puzzles, chess or anything that you’re not immediately good at</li>
<li>
<strong>fun –</strong> you can smile/joke/enjoy yourself through the pain and the slog, and can lift up others even when things are objectively not going well</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>what we’re looking for?</strong></h3>
<p>in addition to the personal qualities mentioned above, this role requires the following:</p>
<p><strong>💻 must haves</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>in sf, or willing to relocate</strong></li>
<li><strong>us work permit (we do not currently sponsor h1-bs, opts are fine)</strong></li>
<li><strong>previous coding experience, enough to understand the codebase</strong></li>
<li>demonstration of autonomy and entrepreneurial spirit (side projects, previous companies)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>💻 good to haves</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>previous startup experience</li>
<li>previous founding experience</li>
<li>previous sales experience</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>nsfabiq - not so frequently asked but important questions</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>🧠 why should i join brainbase and not start my own startup?</strong></p>
<p>if you’re accepted into our team, there is no question that we believe you’re capable of running your company. in fact you can be sure that we have all the faith in you that you’ll probably start your own unicorn at some point. but startups are (famously) hard, and it’s usually good practice to see how a good one is run before you start your own. this is truer than ever with the current ai boom, where you really want to see what sets a great ai company from a mediocre one.</p>
<p>as a founding member of our team, you’ll get to experience all the great parts of being a founder (autonomy, talking to customers, shipping, culture creation) without any of the overhead (fundraising, operations, taxes). in the end, if you choose to leave to start your own journey, we’ll do everything we can to support you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>🧠 why do i need to be technical for a sales role?</strong></p>
<p>one of our core principles at brainbase is to <em>build what you sell and sell what you build</em>. this means that every member of our founding team is required to have a wholistic view of both our engineering and sales efforts. as such, while we don’t expect you to be as excellent in our stack as our engineers, you are required to have reasonable prior experience in coding so that you can have excellent communication with the developers and be able to intimately understand the product you’re bringing to our users. the same requirement goes for our engineers, whose application processes involve sales and operations trials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>🧠 i’d like to join, but i don’t think i’m head of sales material</strong></p>
<p>if you’re in doubt, and satisfy the must have’s from above, you should apply. we love having exceptional people join our team in any capacity and we might end up seeing something in you that you don’t yet yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>🧠 what’s the application process like?</strong></p>
<p>we vary the application process based on what we can already gather from your resume and previous experiences but you should expect (1) a screening phone call, (2) two reference checks (manager and colleague), (3) running an end-to-end sales campaign, (4) reporting results, (5) final wrap-up call.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>about brainbase</h2>
<p>brainbase is an ai workflow automation builder designed to handle complex enterprise workflows. our customers use us to spin up everything from sales autopilots to full fledged customer support workflows in less than a day.</p>
<p>smbs and unicorns choose us over our competitors because we are the only platform that combines the power of ai with the ease and robustness of an off-the-shelf enterprise tool.</p>

<h2>skills / experience 🤹🏽</h2>
<p>(almost) nothing here is a hard requirement, clearly the more the better but we certainly don't expect you to have it all:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 years of experience in operations management, preferably in a client-facing role</li>
<li>proven track record of managing client relationships and delivering exceptional service</li>
<li>strong knowledge of spreadsheets and experience managing complex formulas and building processes</li>
<li>experience in capacity planning and project management</li>
<li>excellent communication skills, both verbal and written</li>
<li>experience with linear/jira type tools</li>
<li>experience with analysing data</li>
<li>ability to work remotely and manage teams without in-person interaction</li>
<li>strong leadership skills and ability to provide guidance and support to a team</li>
<li>ability to think strategically in complex and difficult situations</li>
<li>strong sense of urgency and ability to prioritise tasks</li>
<li>be open and flexible on schedules</li>
<li>confident and understandable spoken english.</li>
</ul>
<h2>job role 📋</h2>
<ul>
<li>as the first “ops” hire you will initially be handling all of the day to day aspects of an operations team - and as the company grows you will hire a team underneath you</li>
<li>you’ll need to very quickly ramp up on our products and all things voip</li>
<li>you will be providing second line support to our largest customers on a dedicated phone line - this may involve
<ul>
<li>investigating call quality issues by looking at logs in twilio</li>
<li>troubleshooting and attempting to reproduce issues across our ios/android/softphone apps and work with the engineering team to proritise fixes</li>
<li>explaining new features</li>
<li>managing client expectations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>you’ll spend some time dealing with chargeback, refund and fraud issues</li>
<li>we don’t currently have a product manager - so you’ll be doing this as part of your role, which will involve
<ul>
<li>collecting feedback from our customers, feeding back to engineering and helping to plan and prioritise engineering work</li>
<li>informing both customers and internal stakeholders when new features/bug fixes are expected</li>
<li>helping to manage the release process for our ios and android apps</li>
<li>writing release notes for new features to help educate our clients and sales team</li>
<li>creating tickets and managing the lifecycle of customer facing features</li>
<li>use our product analytics platform to help understand feature adoption as well as pro-actively identify new areas of work to drive revenue or increase customer satisfaction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>you’ll need to be creative and proactive in implementing solutions to critical issues</li>
<li>as the company grows, you will hire and onboard new team members and support in onboarding new team members into adjacent roles</li>
<li>you’ll generally identify and implement improvement in any areas to help drive operational efficiency, as well as identify areas of process improvement and efficiency and scope new processes when needed</li>
<li>as the company grows there may be scope to move more into a product manager role instead of the ops/customer success role.</li>
<li>we have sane, flexible working hours - even though we’re a fast growing startup we know it’s a marathon and not a sprint</li>
</ul>
<h2>bugs 🐛</h2>
<p>perhaps these are red flags (and we'd all like to find that out sooner rather than later), but hopefully they're a list of things you're up for working on together.</p>
<ul>
<li>we’re a small startup and we currently have more customers asking for features than we have engineering resources for - so you’ll need to have great intuition on must-have features all our customers are clamouring for, and which are just “nice to have” that we can ship later</li>
<li>we don’t have an awful lot of process - so you’ll need to identify areas we can improve, come with solutions, get buy in from the team and implement</li>
<li>there are quite a few processes that aren’t written down - things like how we add numbers from different countries and how much it costs per minute that we’d like to make more “self serve”</li>
<li>there’s not an easy way for our sales team to see which features are available on which platform, so you’ll be answering product questions from the sales team - and help us build processes so they can find the information out themselves easily</li>
<li>you’ll be a team of one to start with - and there’s no set timeline for when the team will expand, so there will be some grunt work and hectic periods as we grow</li>
</ul>
<h2>devyce 📱</h2>
<p>we’re currently around 12 people strong, roughly split evenly between developers and sales/ops.</p>
<p>we are based in london with a small office near fenchurch street. however our dev team happens to be entirely remote across europe and central asia. if you'd prefer to be in the office we'll get you set up - the sales team are there tues - thurs. you’ll probably need to go there from time to time (more than once a month) and so being uk based is going to be a significant advantage.</p>
<h2>our one hard requirement 🛑</h2>
<p>enthusiasm for our product and willingness to understand it, pitch in, suggest changes and improvements, and spot issues before they become problems.</p>

<p>we’re looking to hire a full-stack software engineer to start our internal tooling and data pipeline team. our company uses internal metrics to make all its decisions. we want to invest more resources into making it easier to access these metrics and have team leads get the numbers they need to do their jobs at the highest possible level. your job would be to create a seamless pipeline to pull data from all our data sources (hubspot, gong, notion, github, our product) and create dashboards based on the data team leads want. along with that, building internal tools that help alleviate our team's stress, which could be migration tools, internal sales dashboards, and more. you’ll also create tools to help manage our build and deployment pipelines.</p>
<p>we are built on a react, react native, node, mysql, and mongodb stack. we are entirely inside the amazon web services system and utilize tools like rds, ec2, s3, elastic beanstalk, and cloudfront. you’ll be responsible for creating both the front and back end for these internal tools, and we’ll give you the freedom to work on internal tooling independently from our core product development. you’ll be maintaining your own separate list of features, bugs, and tasks. you will also be reporting directly to the ceos and vp of engineering, so you must be very capable of communicating and bringing ideas to life in stressful situations.</p>
<h3><strong>responsibilities</strong></h3>
<p>we want to bring someone in with a good understanding and ability to handle working on the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>data pipelines -</strong> pull data from multiple data sources and compile them into a singular source that can be accessible in real-time. massive amounts of data will be pushed through these pipelines, and they will always have to be flowing with up-to-date data.</li>
<li>
<strong>data insights -</strong> using the data pipeline you create, create dashboards and scripts to serve this data as meaningful insights. team leads will determine and request these insights and metrics, and they should be able to access them at any time.</li>
<li>
<strong>internal tooling -</strong> create tools for our teams that will improve the lives of our employees. these could be anything from tools that make account migration and onboarding easier to tools that make handling support cases faster.</li>
<li>
<strong>deployments</strong> - create systems and tools to help manage our deployment pipelines across our multiple apps, websites, and servers.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>what we’re looking for</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>someone with at least a year of actual software development experience.</li>
<li>has a deep understanding of how apis work and how to cache and set up data pipelines between them.</li>
<li>has a growth mindset and is ready to learn and work to build a system independent of our core product.</li>
<li>understands and has built deployment pipelines across apps, websites, and servers.</li>
<li>has a good understanding of how startups work firsthand or through other means.</li>
<li>ability to bring ideas to code in an extremely timely manner</li>
</ul>

<p>we embrace the no-rules rules culture originating from netflix. we believe in unlimited time off, no approvals, no overbearing managers, and a culture of transparency and constructive feedback. we ask that you work as hard as possible to bring the customer and company vision to life.</p>
<p>we have an office in manhattan, and we believe in-person work really helps build our culture and is generally a lot more fun. <strong>we are an entirely in-person team and require office attendance five days a week</strong>. as a company, we take an hour off to cater lunches and have time for everyone to sit down and talk about their day.</p>
