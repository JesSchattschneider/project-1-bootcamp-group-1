# Project plan

## Objective

> The objective of our project is to provide analytical datasets from jobs posted in Findwork API and their relation to the population size of where these opportunities are available.

## Consumers

New data engineers who want to know where to look for jobs and which cities have the potential of being less competitive based on their population size.

## Questions

> - Are remote jobs growing over time?
> - What job roles are most common?
> - What are the most common employment types?
> - What is the population of the top 10 cities with more job opportunities? 

## Source datasets

| Source name | Source type | Source documentation |
| - | - | - |
| Population data | csv | TBC |
| findwork API | REST API | [DOCS](https://findwork.dev/developers/#api-key) |

The data available through the API gets updated everytime a new job is posted.
